          Clearview Digest was founded in 2020 by a team of passionate language enthusiasts and legal experts. Frustrated by the 
          lack of user-friendly tools for understanding terms and conditions, they set out to bridge the communication gap between
          legal documents and everyday users. Drawing on their expertise in software development and linguistic analysis, they 
          developed a series of extensions that seamlessly integrate with popular web browsers and applications.
