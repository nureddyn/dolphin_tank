        points without having to read through the entire document. Furthermore, it may provide visual

         of terms and conditions agreements. By simplifying the language and providing explanations, it 
         aims to bridge the gap between legal terminology and everyday understanding. This can be

        It is important to note that while the browser extension can assist in simplifying terms and conditions,
         it does not replace the need for reading and understanding the original legal agreements. Users should still 
         exercise caution and consult legal professionals if they have specific concerns or questions regarding any
         terms or clauses.
